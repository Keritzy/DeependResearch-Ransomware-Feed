This is a Python script to download DeependResearch's ransomware feed every 24 hours into a local .CSV file.




Deepend Research are a threat intelligence group with an emphasis on discovering malware, botnet tracking, underground economy and cybercrime.

Using a RaspberryPi, this group has created a feed mapping out Ransomware domains. They've done this by tapping into the Harry71 onion spider robot, Ahmia search engine and the VisiTOR hidden service links. 

After enumerating the .onion sites, they combine the data with known Web2Tor gateways that are commonly used by malware authors, and compile a suggested notification or block list.
